- 👋 Hi, I’m @riddy18
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning for Resource Optimization especially when applied to High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Precision Agriculture. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Reinforcement Learning techniques like Q-learning, Actor-Critic models, and the best practices in data science especially in data wrangling, hypothesis testing, and causal inferences.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting and challenging AI problems.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me arokanlawon@ksu.edu
